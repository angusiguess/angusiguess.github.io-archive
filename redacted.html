        <p>redaction</p>

        <p>
            <span>there are some interesting qualities that separate</span> redaction <span>from elision or erasure. there</span> is<span>, at least in government redaction,
            a tacit idea that text is being redacted to protect someone. this process is also sometimes called</span> sanitization, <span>the idea being</span>
            that information is removed from a document in order to make that document safe for consumption for a wider audience.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>this safety sometimes manifests in ways that that are borderline absurd, as Simone Brown demonstrates in the records released to
            her via FOIA request.</span> Frantz Fanon is long dead, <span>surely any intelligence gathering assets and techniques involved in gathering data
            about him are moot, and yet white </span>bars <span>try to </span>protect <span>some unknown</span> author or viewer.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>these ideas of cleanliness, of safety, of</span> tailoring information for <span>the ideological consumption of hegemonic culture, reveal a redaction
            that operates in our lives, our gaze, the information that's transmitted to us. Christina Sharpe comments on images of black suffering that
            purport to "humanize" Black people, to manifest </span>"humanity" <span>that we already know to be present.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>when a font is variable width, with each glyph having its own width (not like this one),</span> it's often possible to <span>reverse the process of redaction,
            to </span>determine <span>by the width of the redacted portions some of the possible text strings that could compose that portion. in this way, redaction can
            sometimes function as leaky, exposing, if not the original text, </span>a small number of possibilities <span>as to what that text might be</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>in my dark matters readings, i've often been left with the impression that i've never read a book before. why, in my</span> privilege<span>, have i
            never sought out a Fanon if i've read discipline and punish? why do opinions i held about software and surveillance just a few weeks ago,
            even though they were framed from a point of view of resistance, strike me now as almost reactionary?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>ideology has the advantage of sometimes even being able to frame its resistance. libertarian beliefs are annoying without end because they
            imagine that taxation is the worst enemy of liberation, lack of</span> acknowledgement<span>of clear o- and re-pression.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>so too do concerns of</span> 'informed consent', 'agreement', 'opt-in' <span>policies when dealing with destructive snitch monopolies seem hollow to me now.
            my criticisms come from an anticapitalist place, and i knew that dna was being given to cops, that cell tower data being given to ice, that
            </span>capability, on a long enough timeline, would end <span>up being intent for cops or a tech monopolists or banks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>that Fanon could say that modernity can be characterized by the "mise en fiches de lâ€™homme" in 1959 says much for his insight and the conditions
            of </span>surveillance and power <span>he was able to witness</span>.<span> like foucault demonstrated that, for some, punishment became increasingly abstract through
            the performance of discipline, the modern subject's body of data has also been made more abstract.</span> it has been <span>folded, spindled, mutilated,</span> aggregated,
            <span>redacted, annotated, commodified</span>, shared, rebranded.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>to avoid repeating foucault's mistake, we must acknowledge that this abstraction is not evenly distributed. that the power of surveillance has
            often become a suggestion or a threat or a possibility for the bourgeois subject of modern technology does not preclude surveillance that powers
            the blunt instruments of white supremacy, of settler-colonialism, of heteropatriarchy, of empire. our resistance cannot be phrased as the resistance
            of those who see themselves as</span> "empowered" by technology, <span>but as </span>resistance <span>that demands that we defang surveillance itself and the power structures
            it serves.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>any technique that </span>can deliver <span>an ad can deliver a squad car or a hellfire missile. capability is intent</span>.
