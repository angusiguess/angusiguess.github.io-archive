### Profile

Interested in designing and building distributed systems and addressing the many
problems that might come up in that process.

### Experience

#### LiveOps Cloud Platform / Serenova

*Staff Engineer*

__2014-2017__

 Here I've helped architect a new system, built a number of libraries and services
 for this system, specified and build an integration testing tool, for which I led
 a team, and currently head up our core services team. Everything I've worked on
 here was in Clojure.

#### Introhive

*Rubyist, Git Wrangler*

__2012-2014__

  As an early stage hire for Introhive, I initially worked part-time while going
  to school debugging and working on features. After graduating, I continued to
  work there, maintaining and adding features to our ruby on rails app, contributing
  to architecture discussion, and introducing version control workflows to address
  employee growth.

#### Department of National Defense

#### University of New Brunswick

### Teaching

I maintain a blog at [blog.goose.haus](blog.goose.haus) where I write about some of
my technical side projects.

I've spoken twice at [Maritime Devcon](http://maritimedevcon.ca/), once about testing
distributed systems, and once about error handling in asynchronous systems, inspired
heavily by Joe Armstrong's Erlang dissertation.

I've spoken once at [Clojure West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiK0SmaqN20) about
my work on building a NES emulator based on immutable data in Clojurescript.

### Interests

I like cycling, music, reading, recreational programming, cooking, learning new things.

### Skills

I like to learn new things but in the last few years I've worked quite a bit with
Clojure, Cassandra, Zookeeper, git, mysql, om (I've dabbled), elasticsearch,
AWS, docker and docker-compose. I wrote this resume in emacs.
